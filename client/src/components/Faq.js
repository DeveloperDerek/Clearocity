                <p>Does it work and how?</p>
                <p>Our product has been tested and has proven to work for most of our consumers. Protein peptides is by-far one of the most effective ways to fix under-eye bags because of its ability to stimulate collagen. By applying a small amount of our cream, you will see results in a matter of minutes.</p>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <p>How long does it last and or is it permanent?</p>
                <p>Clearocityâ€™s Miracle Cream is not a permanent solution for eye-bags, but you may apply it every day. Typically, the effect of the cream lasts for 6-8 hours. You may re-apply the product if you start to see diminishing effects. If used occasionally, a whole bottle should last you more than 2 months.</p>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <p>How come the product is not working for me?</p>
                <p>The product may have been applied wrong or there was too much oil on your face. We suggest washing your face and letting it fully dry, then apply a small amount, lightly dab your eye bags, then fan it to let it dry properly. Our Miracle Cream, as miracle as it is, sometimes does not work for everybody, which is why we offer a 7-day money back guarantee.</p>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <p>Does it work for dark circles?</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, our product is only effective for eye-bags. It will not work for dark circles. We may release a new line of products for dark circles in the future.</p>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <p>Can I apply makeup too?</p>
                <p>Yes, you can apply make-up after applying our cream. It is necessary that you do not use any oils as a layer above our cream; otherwise, you may see diminishing effects.</p>
